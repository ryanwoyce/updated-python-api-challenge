Module 6 Challenge - Resubmitted

The "WeatherPy" folder tis where you will find the code for both parts of this challenege. Part one, "WeatherPy.ipynb" and part 2 "VacationPy.ipynb".

The "output_data" folder is where you will find the csv used for this challenge as well as the  four figures I uplaoded form part one of the challenge. 

The gitnore file was used to protect the API keys that I used for the challenge.
